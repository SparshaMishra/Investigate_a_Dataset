# Investigate_a_Dataset
In this project, an analysis was performed on the TMBd dataset where I laid out the deatils of my findings. For this project, data anlalysis was performed by looking at the dataset and then brainstorming what questions could be answered by using it. Then with the use of pandas and NumPy, most of the questions are answered.

For this analysis, I have studied the TMBd datset - This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
